# Finance 101 for the NHS

## ICB Budget Allocation

An Integrated Care Board (ICB) is responsible for planning and commissioning most NHS services for its local population. This includes services such as:

* Hospital and community health services (NHS trusts)
* Primary care (GP services)
* Mental health services
* Some specialist and out-of-hospital care
* Prescribing and medicines

ICBs receive an annual allocation from NHS England. This is based on:

* A **capitation formula** — adjusting for population size, demographics, deprivation, rurality, and health needs.
* Other factors like **unavoidable costs** (e.g., London weighting) and **previous year’s performance**.

## How ICBs Spend Their Budget
The ICB spends its allocation primarily through contracts with providers. These are structured in various ways:

#### Common Contract Models:

| Contract Type                      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Block Contracts**                | A fixed amount paid to a provider regardless of activity levels (often used during COVID or for stability). |
| **Activity-Based Contracts (PbR)** | Payment by Results — based on activity and national tariffs (e.g., per outpatient visit, per surgery).      |
| **Blended Payment Models**         | A combination of block and activity payments — including quality measures and outcomes.                     |
| **Aligned Incentive Contracts**    | Designed to share financial risk and reward across providers and commissioners to promote integrated care.  |

#### ICB budgets also include expenditure on:

* Primary care prescribing (based on actual drug costs)
* Continuing healthcare (CHC) and social care integration
* Private providers, community care, hospices
* Administrative costs and transformation funds
* These aren't always reflected in provider cost collections.


## Provider Cost vs. ICB Spend

#### 1. Provider Cost = Cost of Delivering the Service
* Derived from the National Cost Collection (NCC).
* Represents the actual internal cost to the provider (staff, equipment, overheads, etc.).
* Reported per service / activity unit (e.g., cost per procedure, per bed day).
* Varies by provider, depending on efficiency, case mix, and cost base.

#### 2. ICB Expenditure = What the ICB Pays
* This is the **agreed price**, not the cost.
* Could be lower or higher than actual cost, depending on:
    * National Tariff
    * Local negotiations
    * Contract type (block vs PbR)
    * Adjustments for quality, performance, penalties, or incentives
* Prescribing and GP costs are also ICB spend but not always visible in NCC.

> Example: A hip replacement may cost £8,000 to a provider (NCC), but the ICB may pay £7,200 (national tariff), or £6,500 as part of a block payment — or higher if penalties aren't applied.


## Recommendations for Cost Saving Analysis
If you're identifying cost savings opportunities:

#### Use NCC to:
* Benchmark provider efficiency (compare actual delivery costs across providers).
* Identify outliers or high-cost variations for similar services.
* Highlight potential internal provider cost-reduction opportunities.

#### Use ICB expenditure data to:
* Understand the true financial outflow from the ICB.
* Identify commissioning inefficiencies — e.g., overpaying relative to NCC cost.
* Pinpoint contractual opportunities — renegotiate block deals, shift to performance-based contracts.

> A keen insight is in comparing NCC cost vs ICB payment for the same service.

## Other Key Concepts

### 1. National Tariff
The **National Tariff Payment System (NTPS)** is a set of nationally mandated prices and payment rules set by NHS England and NHS Improvement that determines how providers are paid for the care they deliver to NHS patients. It ensures:

* Standardized pricing for common services across providers
* Incentives for efficiency
* Fair funding across the NHS

The national tarrif covers **secondary care services** (inpatient, outpatient, A&E, diagnostics, etc.). Though it mostly applies to elective and emergency secondary care specifically (e.g. outpatient attendances, surgeries, A&E, diagnostics) 

Through the tarrif, these services are paid for through **Payment by Results (PbR)** (i.e., per unit of activity delivered).

Each activity belongs to a **Health Resource Group (HRG)** which is simply a set of clinically similar treatments. A fixed national price is set for each HRG.

> Example: HRG code “HB12Z” might represent a hip replacement. The 2024/25 tariff price could be £7,500.

ICBs pay providers based on these tariffs, unless there's a local variation or block contract in place.

#### How Tariffs Are Constructed
Tariff = National Average Cost × Efficiency Adjustment + Top-ups (if applicable)

* Based on provider-reported cost data (NCC)
* Adjusted for:
    * Efficiency savings (e.g. 1.1% expected productivity gain)
    * Market Forces Factor (MFF)
    * Specialist or teaching hospital top-ups (if relevant)


### 2. Market Forces Factor (MFF)
The Market Forces Factor is an adjustment made to reflect the unavoidable cost differences faced by providers due to their location — such as:

* Local labour market costs (e.g. higher wages in London)
* Building and land costs
* Business rates

It exists to level the playing field, so that providers in high-cost areas aren’t penalised for factors they can't control.

> For example, a hospital in inner London might have an MFF of 1.20, while one in the North East might have an MFF of 1.00 or less.

#### How MFF Affects Payments and Cost Reporting
In tariff payments, ICBs pay more to providers with a higher MFF because the tariff is uplifted.

* **Tariff with MFF = Base Tariff × MFF**

```
Example:
Cataract surgery base tariff = £1,200
Provider MFF = 1.15
ICB pays: £1,380 (instead of £1,200)
```

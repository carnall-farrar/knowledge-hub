# Levels of Care

* **Primary care** is anything you access directly. This includes general practitioners (GPs), health visitors, dentists and opticians. Primary care provides the first point of contact in the healthcare system. It is the route by which we most commonly access other parts of the NHS, such as hospital care.​
* **Secondary care** describes the sort of services you might be referred to if your child needs to be seen by someone with more specialist knowledge. Secondary care includes hospital services, Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHS) and child development centres. A referral from a primary care practitioner is required to access secondary care.​
* **Tertiary care** is the specialist end of the NHS, and you might use these services if you have a very complex or rare condition. Tertiary care includes specialist hospitals, such as Great Ormond Street, Alder Hey and Bristol Children’s hospital. A referral from a secondary practitioner is generally required to access tertiary care.​
